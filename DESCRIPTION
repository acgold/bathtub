Description: bathtub is a set of tools that allows users to model the impacts of 
    inundation on stormwater networks. bathtub does this by combining spatial 
    representations of the stormwater network and landscape with a 1-dimensional 
    model of the stormwater network. The spatial data allows for estimates of 
    overland flooding extents and the 1-D model uses the overland flooding extent 
    as a starting point. The 1-D model then propogates flooding through the stormwater 
    network based on network invert elevations and known obstructions (optional).
